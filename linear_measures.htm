<title>Taking Linear Measurements</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Taking the linear dimensions of the wheelchair</h1>
<p>This can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol><li>Measure the wheelbase of the wheelchair</li>
<li>Measure the dimensions shown below, and use the 'Calculate Wheelbase' button in the data form. As it is easier to more accurately measure the dimensions shown in the figure below and calculate the wheelbase, this would be the preferred way and is likely to reduce measurement error.</li></ol>
<p>This should be done with the castor positioned as if the wheelchair is being pushed forwards (as in the photo, not as in the diagram).</p>

<p>1) Measure the Rear Axle height. This must be the vertical distance from the floor to the centre of the axle.</p>

<p>2) Measure the Front Axle height. This must be the vertical distance from the floor to the centre of the axle.</p>

<p>3) Measure the distance between the centres of the front and rear axles.</p>
